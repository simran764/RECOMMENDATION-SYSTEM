# Description
The main objective of this task is to:

Build a system that suggests relevant items to users based on their preferences or behavior.

Learn and implement collaborative filtering or matrix factorization.

Evaluate and interpret recommendation performance.

Recommendation systems have become a core technology behind platforms such as Netflix (movie suggestions), Amazon (product recommendations), Spotify (music discovery), and YouTube (video recommendations).

Key Concepts
Recommendation Systems:
These systems aim to predict what a user might be interested in based on historical data. There are three main types:

Content-Based Filtering (based on item features)

Collaborative Filtering (based on user-item interactions)

Hybrid Models (combination of the above two)

Collaborative Filtering:
This technique relies on the assumption that users with similar preferences in the past will continue to have similar tastes. Itâ€™s further divided into:

User-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items liked by similar users.

Item-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items similar to those the user liked.

Matrix Factorization:
An advanced collaborative filtering technique that decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional matrices representing latent factors of users and items. Common algorithms include:

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

Alternating Least Squares (ALS)

Implementation Steps
Import Libraries:
Use libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and optionally surprise or lightfm (for matrix factorization). For visualization, matplotlib or seaborn can be helpful.

Dataset Selection:
Choose an appropriate dataset such as:

MovieLens (movie ratings)

Amazon product reviews

GoodBooks-10K
These datasets typically consist of users, items (like movies or books), and ratings or interactions.

Data Preprocessing:

Clean and structure the dataset.

Create a user-item interaction matrix.

Normalize data if required (for matrix factorization).

Handle missing values (either by imputation or ignoring sparse entries).

Choose Recommendation Technique:
Depending on your approach, implement one of the following:

User-based or Item-based Collaborative Filtering: Use cosine similarity or Pearson correlation between users/items.

Matrix Factorization (e.g., SVD): Use libraries like scikit-surprise to apply dimensionality reduction to the user-item matrix.

Model Training:

For collaborative filtering, calculate similarity matrices and identify top-N recommendations.

For matrix factorization, train the model using optimization algorithms (e.g., ALS) to learn latent features.

Prediction and Recommendation:

Predict ratings for unrated items.

Generate top-N recommendations for each user.

Allow filtering based on user input or category if designing an interactive system.

Evaluation Metrics:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) for rating prediction accuracy.

Precision@K, Recall@K, F1-score, or Hit Rate for top-N recommendation quality.

Use train-test splits or cross-validation to ensure reliable evaluation.

Visualization and Insights:

Show recommendation samples.

Display similarity matrices or rating distributions.

Plot performance metrics to compare models.

Deliverables
You are required to submit a Jupyter Notebook or a functional application that:

Loads and processes a dataset

Implements a recommendation technique

Outputs personalized item suggestions

Includes evaluation metrics and visual summaries

Ensure your code is clean, well-commented, and accompanied by markdown cells explaining your process and findings.
